# 📒 Twitter Clone - Frontend

<br>

### Twitter Clone Project


It is a project where users can sign up, have their sessions checked after logging in, and perform actions liking,sharing, deleting tweets.They can upload images and gifs and post tweets single or draft.

For frontend used React.js, HTML and CSS for frontend. Node.js express for api and Firebase Authentication was used for authentication. Bootstrap was used for responsible design.
For api used Node.js express. Used Express Session for controlling user's session also used Google authentication for creating account. Made database interactions with MongoDB.
Created my own RichTextbox kinda tweeting post functionality.
